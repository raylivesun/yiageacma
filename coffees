Okay, let's talk about **coffee and hydration**. This is a common point of confusion!

Here's the breakdown:

1.  **Coffee Contains Water:** A standard cup of brewed coffee is mostly water (over 98%). This water content definitely contributes to your daily fluid intake.

2.  **Caffeine is a Mild Diuretic:** Caffeine *does* have a mild diuretic effect, meaning it can make your kidneys produce slightly more urine in the short term. This is where the idea that "coffee dehydrates you" comes from.

3.  **The Net Effect:** For moderate coffee consumption (generally considered up to about 400mg of caffeine per day, roughly 3-4 standard cups of brewed coffee), the amount of water consumed in the coffee typically **offsets** the mild diuretic effect of the caffeine.

4.  **Tolerance:** People who regularly consume caffeine develop a tolerance, and the diuretic effect becomes even less significant. Someone who rarely drinks coffee might notice the diuretic effect more than a daily drinker.

**Conclusion:**

*   **Moderate coffee consumption contributes to your daily hydration needs.** It does *not* typically lead to dehydration.
*   While coffee can be part of your fluid intake, **plain water is still the best and optimal choice for pure hydration**, as it has no calories, sugar, or diuretic compounds.
*   Excessive coffee intake (well beyond 4-5 cups a day) *could* potentially lead to a net negative fluid balance due to the diuretic effect, but this is less common and usually accompanied by other side effects of too much caffeine (jitters, anxiety, sleep disturbance).

So, you can count your regular cups of coffee towards your daily fluid goals, but don't rely on it as your *primary* source of hydration.
