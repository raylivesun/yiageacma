# 2.  **Analyze the Comments:**
#     *   The comments repeatedly state the script is for PowerShell 
#     and uses a command called `chucfeek`.
#     *   The repetition might be accidental or just for emphasis.
#     *   The key takeaway from the comments is the script's intended environment 
#     (PowerShell) and a dependency on an external command (`chucfeek`). Note: 
#     `chucfeek` is *not* a standard PowerShell command.
