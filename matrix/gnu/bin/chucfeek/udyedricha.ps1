# 5.  **Identify Key PowerShell Concepts:**
#     *   Preference Variables (`$ErrorActionPreference`, etc.): How PowerShell 
#     *   controls the behavior of cmdlets and scripts regarding output streams and error 
#     *   handling.
#     *   Action Preferences (`Stop`, `Continue`, `SilentlyContinue`, `Inquire`): The 
#     *   standard values for these preference variables.
#     *   Scope: These preference variable assignments affect the *current* script's 
#     *   scope.
#     *   External Commands: PowerShell can run external executables 
#     *   (`.exe`, `.com`, etc.) like `chucfeek` (assuming it exists and is in 
#     *   the system's PATH or specified with a full path).
