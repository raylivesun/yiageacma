#     *   The script is explicitly designed for the PowerShell environment.
#     *   Its primary action *so far* is to set up the **behavior** of the PowerShell 
#     *   session *for the duration of the script's execution* (or until these variables are 
#     *   changed again).
#     *   It configures the script to be very "chatty": verbose, debug, warning, 
#     *   information, and progress messages will all be displayed if generated by 
#     *   subsequent commands.
#     *   Crucially, it sets the script to halt immediately if any command encounters 
#     *   a terminating error.
#     *   The comments indicate that the *intended* core functionality 
#     *   (which is *missing* from this snippet) involves calling an external 
#     *   command named `chucfeek`.
