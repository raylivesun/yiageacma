# **2. Comments:**

# *   The initial block of comments repeats the same information:
#     *   The script is intended for **PowerShell**.
#     *   It relies on or uses an external command named **`chucfeek`**.
# *   **Important:** `chucfeek` is **not** a standard built-in PowerShell 
# cmdlet or Windows command. It must be an external program, script, 
# or function that needs to be available on the system where this script 
# is run. The comments emphasize that the *purpose* of this script 
# (or at least the part that would follow this snippet) involves using 
# this specific command.
